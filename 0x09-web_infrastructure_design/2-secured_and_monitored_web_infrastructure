# 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

## Diagram

[Diagram](./diagram2.png)

## Explanation

This setup adds security and monitoring:
- **3 firewalls**: One for each server, restricts unauthorized access.
- **SSL certificate**: Enables HTTPS for secure communication.
- **3 monitoring clients**: Collect data for monitoring (e.g., Sumologic agents).

### Components
- **Firewalls**: Protect servers from unauthorized access.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Encrypts traffic between users and the web server.
- **Monitoring**: Collects metrics (CPU, memory, QPS, etc.) and sends to a monitoring service.
- **QPS Monitoring**: Configure monitoring tool to track web server queries per second.

### Issues
- **SSL Termination at Load Balancer**: Traffic between load balancer and backend may be unencrypted.
- **Single MySQL Writer**: Only one server can accept writes, limiting redundancy.
- **Identical Servers**: If all servers have all components, a compromise affects everything.
