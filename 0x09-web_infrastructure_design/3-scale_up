# 3. Scale up

## Diagram

[Diagram](./diagram3.png)

## Explanation

This setup further scales the infrastructure:
- **1 additional server**: For splitting components.
- **2 load balancers (HAProxy)**: Clustered for high availability.
- **Dedicated servers**: Separate servers for web, application, and database layers.

### Components
- **Load Balancer Cluster**: Two HAProxy instances in Active-Active or Active-Passive mode for redundancy.
- **Split Components**: Web server, application server, and database each on their own server for better performance and isolation.

### Reason for Each Addition
- **Load Balancer Cluster**: Prevents SPOF at the load balancer level.
- **Split Components**: Allows independent scaling and maintenance of each layer.
